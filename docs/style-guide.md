# Content Style Guide

## Formatting Standards
- Use `Intl.NumberFormat` for all currency and number formatting. Ensure the currency is configurable so the same logic can present USD, CAD, and other locales without code changes.
- Present time horizons in a humanized format (for example, "2 years 3 months") instead of raw month counts or decimals.

## Voice and Tone
- Write in plain, accessible language that is neutral toward any specific product or provider.
- Avoid jargon and comparative marketing language.

## Disclaimers
- Display the following disclaimer alongside projected returns or planning illustrations:
  > Assumed annual return for planning only; not a recommendation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation, prototypes, and production surfaces must reference and adhere to this style guide page.
